# R-Simulations
I used R for applying statistical methods, including working with random variables, probability distributions, expectation, variance, and specific distributions. I focused on simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo integration, bootstrapping, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), along with methods for generating random variables like inversion, acceptance-rejection, and transformation. Additionally, I learned to simulate stochastic processes like Poisson and Markov and implemented these methods in R, using my background in probability, statistics, calculus, and programming.
